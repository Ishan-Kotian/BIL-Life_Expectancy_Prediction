# BIL_Project-Life_Expectancy_Prediction
## 1.Overview
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country are given.
This project is to build a model while considering historical data from a period of 2000  to 2015 for all the countries. The model trained in this project will be able to predict the average lifetime of a human being given some input factors .With the help of this  project any country is able to predict the expected lifetime of their countrymen and then accordingly take preventive measures to improve on their healthcare measures. This will also help countries in improving a particular field such as GDP ,alcohol intake,etc which have a high impact on a country's life expectancy.

## 2.Proposed Solution

Although there have been a lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that the effect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on a data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations in this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy.

## 3.Functional Requirements

♢	Download the dataset of WHO

♢	Analyze it and clean the dataset

♢	Train the regression model on different algorithms

♢	Check for the best one and finalize that algorithm to train our mode

♢	The model will return the output as the average predicted lifespan

## 4.Conclusion
Thus, we have developed a model that will predict the life expectancy of a specific demographic region based on the inputs provided. Various factors have a significant impact on the life span such as Adult Mortality, Population, Under 5 Deaths, Thinness 1-5 Years, Alcohol, HIV, Hepatitis B, GDP, Percentage Expenditure and many more.

## 5.Future Scope
As future scope, we can connect the model to the database which can predict the life Expectancy of not only human beings but also of the plants and different animals present on the earth. This will help us analyze the trends in the life span. A model with country wise bifurcation can be made, which will help to segregate the data demographically.
